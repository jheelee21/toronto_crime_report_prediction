# Application of Machine-Learning approaches to Crime Type Prediction using Neighbourhood Information and Police Report in Toronto

For emergency services, whether a reported crime is of high or low risk is a critical piece of information which determines response priority and scale. However, such information may be missing at the time of the initial report. We provide a comparison of different prediction models ranging from widely-used Decision Trees and Naive-Bayes' estimation to a more niche approach using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). Results show that the BNN achieves similar performance to Decision Trees and KDE estimation but provides a built-in confidence metric alongside its predictions, as well as being robust to noisy, imbalanced data.
